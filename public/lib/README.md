This project requires the Live2D Cubism Core runtime (`live2dcubismcore.min.js`) for rendering.

Due to Live2D's licensing terms, the Cubism Core file is NOT included in this repository.

How to provide it locally:
1. Download the official "Cubism SDK for Web" from Live2D.
2. Locate `live2dcubismcore.min.js` in the SDK package.
3. Copy it to:

`astrbot-live2d-desktop/public/lib/live2dcubismcore.min.js`

The file is intentionally ignored by git to avoid accidental publishing.
